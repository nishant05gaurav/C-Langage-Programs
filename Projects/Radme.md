This is a simple mini project in C programming.

- The game is to be played between two people (player1 and player2).
- We've assigned 'X' to the player-1 and 'O' to the player-2.
- The game starts with player-1 and the game ends when one of the players completes whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective symbol (‘O’ or ‘X’).
- If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
